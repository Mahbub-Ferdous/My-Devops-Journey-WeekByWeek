# Day 1: Introduction to DevOps

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a cultural and procedural shift aimed at improving application delivery by fostering collaboration between development and operations teams. This approach emphasizes automation, maintaining high quality, and ensuring continuous monitoring and testing to streamline workflows and reduce the time to market.

## Why DevOps?

The primary goals of DevOps include:

```Increased Efficiency: Streamlining processes to deliver products faster.```
```Improved Collaboration: Breaking down silos between development and operations teams.```
```Enhanced Quality: Ensuring continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) to maintain high standards.```
```Scalability and Reliability: Building robust and scalable systems with automated monitoring and alerting.```

## How to Introduce Yourself?

When introducing yourself in the context of DevOps, include your past experiences and how they have shaped your understanding and approach to DevOps. Mention specific tools, technologies, and projects you have worked on that are relevant to DevOps practices.

## Day-to-Day Activities

DevOps day-to-day activities can vary, but typically include:

```Automating Workflows: Setting up CI/CD pipelines to automate code integration, testing, and deployment.```
```Monitoring Systems: Implementing monitoring and alerting systems to ensure application performance and reliability.```
```Collaborating with Teams: Working closely with development, QA, and operations teams to streamline processes.```
```Configuring Infrastructure: Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to manage infrastructure.```
```Incident Management: Responding to incidents and troubleshooting issues to minimize downtime.```

# Day 2: Understanding the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The SDLC consists of several phases that guide the development of software applications:

```Planning: Determine the product's module, scope, and requirements. This phase involves gathering requirements, feasibility studies, and defining project goals.```
```Defining: Document the application module requirements in a Software Requirement Document (SRD). This includes specifying functional and non-functional requirements.```
```Designing: Create the module design according to the SRD. This involves developing High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) documents, and designing the user interface (UI/UX).```
```Building: Develop the module based on the chosen tech stack and design. This phase includes coding, integrating different components, and version control.```
```Testing: Test the developed module to ensure it meets the requirements. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).```
```Deployment: Deploy the module for user access. This phase involves releasing the software to production, configuring environments, and monitoring deployment.```
```Repeat: Iterate these phases for each application module. Continuous feedback and improvement are key to the SDLC.```

## DevOps in SDLC

In DevOps, the focus is on automating or minimizing manual efforts in the "Building --> Testing --> Deployment" phases. This is achieved through:

```Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically integrating code changes and running tests.```
```Continuous Delivery (CD): Ensuring that code changes are automatically deployed to a staging environment.```
```Continuous Deployment: Automatically deploying code changes to production.```

# Day 3: Introduction to Virtual Machines (VM) - Part 1



## What are Virtual Machines?

Virtual Machines (VMs) are created by logically isolating physical machines using a hypervisor. The hypervisor allocates CPU, RAM, and storage resources to these isolated environments, allowing multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine.

## Examples of VMs

```AWS EC2: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) allows you to request and run virtual servers (instances) from specific data centers around the world, such as Mumbai, Singapore, Ohio, etc.```
```Azure Virtual Machines: Microsoft Azure provides virtual machines that can be deployed in various regions globally, offering scalability and high availability.```

## Benefits of VMs

```Resource Isolation: Each VM operates independently, providing a secure and isolated environment.```
```Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.```
```Cost Efficiency: Pay for only the resources you use, reducing infrastructure costs.```
```Flexibility: Run different operating systems and applications on the same physical hardware.```

# Day 4: Virtual Machines (VM) - Part 2


## Cloud Providers and VM Services

AWS and Azure are two leading cloud providers offering VMs and a wide range of cloud services. These platforms provide both graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and APIs to manage VMs and other services.

## AWS Virtual Machines

```EC2 Instances: AWS EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It supports a wide range of instance types optimized for different use cases.```
```AWS CLI: Command Line Interface for managing AWS services.
AWS CloudFormation: Service for modeling and setting up your AWS resources using code.```
```AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit): Framework for defining cloud infrastructure using programming languages.```
```BOTO3: AWS SDK for Python, enabling programmatic access to AWS services.```

#Azure Virtual Machines

```Azure VM: Offers scalable compute resources in the Azure cloud. VMs can be configured with different sizes and operating systems.```
```Azure CLI: Command Line Interface for managing Azure resources.```
```Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service for deploying Azure resources.```
```Azure DevOps: Set of development tools for planning, developing, testing, and deploying applications.```
